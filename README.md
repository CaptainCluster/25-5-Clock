# 25 + 5 Clock

25 + 5 Clock, also known as pomodoro timer is the fifth, and the final project, for the *Front End Development Libraries* 
course that is hosted by **FreeCodeCamp**.It utilizes the **React** JavaScript library to build the UI. By default, the
timer counts down on 25-minute (possibly study) sessions and 5-minute breaks. These times can be adjusted by the user.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is a part of **FreeCodeCamp** *Front End Development Libraries Course*. Their example project has been used for inspiration and the
constraints of the test criteria set a foundation on which my vision was built.
